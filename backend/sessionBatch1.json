These microbes are ubiquitous, living on doorknobs, money, and our hands. If someone sneezes into their hand, touches a doorknob, and then you touch the same doorknob, their microbes are now on your hands. If you touch your mouth, nose, or eyes, these microbes can enter your body and potentially make you sick.\n\nHowever, not all microbes cause disease; most are beneficial. For example, some microbes in our gut produce vitamin K, and others are used to ferment beer and wine.\n\nMicrobiologists work in various sectors, including food, veterinary, and medical industries. They also play key roles in the pharmaceutical sector, researching and developing new antibiotic sources to treat bacterial infections. Environmental microbiologists explore ways to use selected or genetically engineered microbes to remove pollutants from soil, groundwater, and contaminated sites\u2014a technology known as bioremediation. Additionally, microbiologists contribute to the field of bioinformatics, offering specialized knowledge for designing, developing, and optimizing computer models, such as those simulating bacterial epidemics.\n\nProkaryotic cells, with a diameter of 0.1 to 5.0 \u03bcm, are significantly smaller than eukaryotic cells, which range from 10 to 100 \u03bcm in diameter. This small size allows ions and organic molecules to quickly diffuse throughout the prokaryotic cell, and wastes to diffuse out. Eukaryotic cells, on the other hand, have developed structural adaptations to enhance intracellular transport."
